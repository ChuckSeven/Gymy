This work is a result of a seminar which is part of the Information Processing and Visualization specialization of the BSc Computer Science course at the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland.

The Gymy is an associative memory construct developed by Prof. Hans Gysin at the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland. In this project, a highly effective GPU optimized implementation has been developed. The goal was to do performance evaluation and to give configuration recommendations for future researchers. Its qualities have been evinced with several example cases including bat species recognition on the basis of their distinctive calls. However, existing implementation is done with MatCat and is, therefore, unsuitable for extensive testing. The theory for this neural network is explained in Prof. Gysin's book "Es ist die Länge" (ISBN-13: 978-3863760809). 

The project as a thorough success. The execution time of the given example has been reduced from ~1760 min (29.3 h) to ~1 min. A final presentation was held in front of a jury of selected lecturers. This work has been marked with a 6 which is the highest possible mark in Switzerland.
